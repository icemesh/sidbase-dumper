# sidbase-dumper
Code for extracting data from a sidbase.bin file used in the Naughty Dog engine.

# What's a sidbase ?
Given that debugging a StringId is hard Naughty Dog decided to store each StringId and their respective meaning in a file called sidbase.bin
This program takes in input a sidbase.bin file and spits out a file called sidbase.txt. In this file you're gonna find each StringId and their respective meaning.

Given that there has been only a leaked sidbase.bin this program only works for said version (ps3 version). 
If there's ever gonna be another leak this program will be updated.
